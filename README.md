# Matthias Vassallo Pulis
<p>Hi, I am Matthias Vassallo Pulis, a <b>3rd year</b> student at the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/" target="_blank">University of Malta</a>, studying for a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence.</p>

## About Me
<p>🎓 My passion for AI began when I discovered its potential and the wide range of applications this technology brings.  I love solving real-world problems using AI. My studies so far have given me a solid foundation in a variety of technical fields, especially in Data Analytics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Game AI, which are considered to be my main personal interests. Alongside these technologies, I have also worked on projects that involved Natural Language Processing (NLP), Robotics, and AI-driven web applications.</p>

<p>💻 Whenever I'm not working on AI projects, I'm constantly looking to improve my skills through hands-on experience with a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java and C#, ensuring versatility across different platforms. This ensures I am prepared for whatever life throws at me.</p>

<p>💼 Apart from that, I also work as a Data Analyst Intern at <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/mt/en.html" target="_blank">Deloitte Malta</a>, which has also given me the opportunity to apply what I learn in my studies in the industry.</p>
